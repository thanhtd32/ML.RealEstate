# ML.RealEstate
Most recently, Microsoft has introduced the ML.NET Model Builder tool to support machine learning predictive system processing, but it has only been introduced in the general model, so it is still difficult to apply into actual house price predictions. Therefore, we applied and improved this model to develop a new model ML.RealEstate that focuses on the private housing price prediction segment. The model will show the most common characteristics for private houses, the model will help people estimate the actual price of the house to avoid financial loss when inflated.
